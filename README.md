## Features

- **Extensible Plugin System**: Support for [JavaScript, File System, and HTTP](#plugins) sources.
- **Modern UI**: A responsive interface built with SwiftUI.
- **High-Performance Readers**: [Continuous and Paged](#reader) reading modes built on UIKit.
- **Smart Grouping**: Deep learning-powered [automatic spread detection](#smart-grouping).
- **Library & History**: Manage your collection and track reading progress.
- **Cross-Device Syncing**: Keep your library in sync using [HttpEngine or Supabase](#syncing).

## Plugins

Mankai is designed to be extensible. It supports three types of plugins, each serving a distinct function:

### JavaScript Plugin (JsPlugin)

This plugin scrapes content from third-party manga websites, allowing you to browse and read manga from various online aggregators directly within the app.

- **Plugins Examples**: [mankai-plugins](https://github.com/nohackjustnoobb/mankai-plugins)

### File System Plugin (FsPlugin)

This plugin manages manga stored as local files stored on your device or a connected service.

- **Syncing**: Point it to a folder in iCloud Drive or other remote storage solutions (e.g., SMB) to sync your library across devices.

### Http Plugin (HttpPlugin)

This plugin is designed for external providers to use Mankai as a reader and, optionally, an editor. It connects to servers implementing the standard API and supports authentication.

- **Specification**: [Mankai API Specification](https://github.com/nohackjustnoobb/mankai-server/blob/master/doc/api.md)
- **Reference Server**: [mankai-server](https://github.com/nohackjustnoobb/mankai-server)

## Reader

Mankai provides two high-performance reading modes, both implemented in UIKit to ensure smooth scrolling and page transitions:

- **Continuous Reader**: A traditional webtoon-style vertical scrolling experience.
- **Paged Reader**: A paginated experience supporting both vertical and horizontal reading directions.

### Smart Grouping

Mankai features an advanced **Smart Grouping** system that uses a deep learning model to detect and merge split-page spreads. By analyzing the visual adjacency of images, the app can automatically group two separate files into a single seamless spread, restoring the original artistic intent.

- **Model Repository**: [mankai-smart-grouping](https://github.com/nohackjustnoobb/mankai-smart-grouping)

#### Performance

| Metric            | Value                   |
| :---------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Base Model**    | `mobilenetv3_large_100` |
| **Test Accuracy** | 99.51%                  |
| **Precision**     | 99.45%                  |
| **Recall**        | 99.55%                  |
| **F1 Score**      | 99.50%                  |

#### Inference

Performance benchmarks on **iPhone 15**:

| Compute Units           | Prediction (Median) | Load (Median) | Compilation (Median) |
| :---------------------- | :------------------ | :------------ | :------------------- |
| **CPU Only**            | 5.81 ms             | 31.56 ms      | 109.14 ms            |
| **CPU + GPU**           | 14.54 ms            | 69.52 ms      | 174.20 ms            |
| **CPU + Neural Engine** | 1.60 ms             | 35.36 ms      | 107.57 ms            |

## Syncing

Mankai supports syncing your library and reading history across devices using the following sync engines:

### HttpEngine

The **HttpEngine** requires a self-hosted server to function. You can host the server yourself using the [mankai-sync](https://github.com/nohackjustnoobb/mankai-sync) repository.

Once hosted, you can configure the server URL in the app settings to enable syncing.

### SupabaseEngine

The **SupabaseEngine** allows you to sync using Supabase as the backend. You can set up your own Supabase project using the database schema provided in the [mankai-supabase](https://github.com/nohackjustnoobb/mankai-supabase) repository.

Once configured, you can enter your Supabase URL and Key in the app settings to enable syncing.

### Planned Sync Engines

- **iCloud** - Pending availability of resources (aka. I have no money)

## Development Notes

**Performance with Debugger Attached (e.g., from Xcode):**

- The startup time will be significantly slower than normal.
- The app may temporarily freeze on the first scroll in the reader screen.

These issues do not occur when running the app without a debugger attached.
